## Email Template 1: The Competitor Comparison

**Subject:** [Medical Spa Name] is losing patients to [Competitor] on ChatGPT

Hi [First Name],

I just asked ChatGPT "What's the best medical spa in [City] for Botox?" 

It recommended [Competitor Name] - not [Their Medical Spa].

Here's why this matters: 40% of people now search via AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, or Google's AI Overview before booking aesthetic treatments.

I analyzed why AI platforms favor [Competitor]:
- They have AI-optimized FAQ content about procedures
- Their treatment pages use semantic structuring AI understands
- They appear in the "local 3-pack" WITH AI-friendly descriptions

Meanwhile, [Medical Spa Name] has:
✗ No structured FAQ content about popular treatments
✗ Generic service descriptions AI can't parse
✗ Missing schema markup for medical procedures

The result? You're invisible to high-value patients searching via AI.

I've prepared a free AI Search Audit showing exactly:
• What AI says about your med spa vs competitors
• 3 specific fixes to get AI recommending you
• Why your competitors appear first

Want to see it? Just reply "AUDIT" and I'll send it over.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. The local 3-pack still matters, but it's evolving. AI now pulls from it to make recommendations. Are you ready?

## Email Template 2: The Direct Question

**Subject:** Quick question about [Medical Spa Name]'s AI visibility

Hi [First Name],

When someone asks AI "What's the best place for [popular treatment] in [City]?" - does your med spa come up?

I checked, and here's what I found:
- ChatGPT: Recommends [Competitor 1] and [Competitor 2]
- Google AI: Shows [Competitor 3] with detailed FAQs
- Perplexity: No mention of [Medical Spa Name]

This isn't about traditional SEO anymore. You might rank #1 on Google, but if AI doesn't know your expertise in [specific treatments], you're missing 40% of potential patients.

The fix is simpler than you think:
1. Structure your content for AI comprehension
2. Create treatment-specific FAQs AI can cite
3. Optimize your local presence for voice search

I've helped [Similar Medical Spa] go from zero AI mentions to being the #1 AI recommendation for [treatment] in [their city] in 47 days.

Interested in seeing how? I can show you exactly what they did.

## Email Template 3: The Case Study Angle

**Subject:** How [Local Competitor] is booking 40% more Botox appointments

Hi [First Name],

[Competitor Medical Spa] just reported a 40% increase in Botox bookings.

Their secret? They're "AI Search Ready."

When prospects search "Is Botox safe?" or "Best med spa for first-time Botox" on ChatGPT or Google's AI Overview, [Competitor] shows up with detailed, trustworthy answers.

Your med spa? Currently invisible to these AI searches.

Here's what being AI Search Ready means:
✓ FAQs structured for AI citation
✓ Treatment pages with semantic markup
✓ Local SEO optimized for voice search
✓ Content that answers real patient questions

The medical spa industry is changing fast. Patients research differently now:
- Old way: Google "med spa near me"
- New way: Ask AI detailed questions about safety, results, and recommendations

I can show you exactly how to become AI Search Ready in 30 days.

Reply with "READY" and I'll send over:
1. Your current AI visibility score
2. What AI says about your competitors
3. A roadmap to dominate AI recommendations

[Your Name]

P.S. The local 3-pack isn't going away - but AI is using it differently now. Make sure you're optimized for both.

## Follow-Up Email Sequence

### Email 2 (Day 3): The Visual Proof
**Subject:** See what ChatGPT says about medical spas in [City]

Hi [First Name],

I promised to show you what AI says about local med spas. Here's a screenshot of ChatGPT's response to "Best medical spa for Botox in [City]":

[Screenshot showing competitor recommendations]

Notice how it:
- Lists specific competitors (not you)
- Mentions their specialties
- Cites their patient reviews
- Recommends booking with them

This happens because their content is structured for AI comprehension. 

Your med spa has better reviews and more experience - but AI doesn't know that.
